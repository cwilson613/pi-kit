# Omegon

An opinionated distribution of [**pi**](https://github.com/badlogic/pi) — the coding agent by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/badlogic). Omegon bundles pi core with extensions for persistent project memory, spec-driven development, local LLM inference, image generation, web search, parallel task decomposition, a live dashboard, and quality-of-life tools.

> **Relationship to pi:** Omegon is not a fork or replacement. It packages pi as a dependency and layers extensions on top. All credit for the pi coding agent goes to Mario Zechner and the pi contributors. The core pi packages (`@cwilson613/pi-coding-agent`) track [upstream `badlogic/pi-mono`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) daily, adding targeted fixes for OAuth login reliability and bracketed-paste input handling. If you want standalone pi without Omegon's extensions, install `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` directly.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g omegon
```

This installs the `pi` command globally. If a standalone pi package is already installed, omegon will transparently replace it (the same `pi` command, with extensions included). To switch back to standalone pi at any time:

```bash
npm uninstall -g omegon
npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent
```

**First-time setup:**

```bash
pi          # start pi in any project directory
/bootstrap  # check deps, install missing tools, configure preferences
```

### Keeping up to date

| What to update | How |
|----------------|-----|
| **Omegon extensions** | `/update` or `pi update` (tracks `main` branch) |
| **pi binary** | `/update-pi` — checks npm for latest `@cwilson613/pi-coding-agent`, prompts before installing |

> The patched fork syncs from upstream daily via GitHub Actions. Bug fixes and new AI provider support land automatically. If a sync PR has conflicts, they are surfaced for manual review before merging — upstream changes are never silently dropped.

> **Note:** `pi install` and `pi update` track the `main` branch. The version-check extension notifies you when a new Omegon release is available.

## Architecture

![Omegon Architecture](docs/img/architecture.png)

Omegon extends `@cwilson613/pi-coding-agent` with **27 extensions**, **12 skills**, and **4 prompt templates** — loaded automatically on session start.

### Development Methodology

Omegon enforces **spec-first development** for non-trivial changes:

![Spec-Driven Pipeline](docs/img/spec-pipeline.png)

The full lifecycle: **design → propose → spec → plan → implement → verify → archive**. Given/When/Then scenarios are the source of truth for correctness — code implements the specs, not the reverse.

## Extensions

### 📋 OpenSpec

Spec-driven development lifecycle — proposal → specs → design → tasks workflow with delta-spec merge on archive.

- **Tool**: `openspec_manage`
- **Commands**: `/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:spec`, `/opsx:ff`, `/opsx:status`, `/opsx:verify`, `/opsx:archive`, `/opsx:sync`
- **Lifecycle stages**: proposed → specified → planned → implementing → verifying → archived
- **API contracts**: When a change involves a network API, derives an OpenAPI 3.1 spec from Given/When/Then scenarios; `/assess spec` validates implementation against it
- Integrates with [OpenSpec CLI](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) profiles

### 🪓 Cleave

Parallel task decomposition with dependency-ordered wave dispatch in isolated git worktrees.

- **Tools**: `cleave_assess` (complexity evaluation), `cleave_run` (parallel dispatch)
- **Commands**: `/cleave <directive>`, `/assess cleave`, `/assess diff`, `/assess spec`
- **OpenSpec integration**: Uses `tasks.md` as the split plan when `openspec/` exists, enriches child tasks with design decisions and spec acceptance criteria, reconciles task completion on merge, guides through verify → archive
- **Skill-aware dispatch**: Auto-matches skill files to children based on file scope patterns (e.g. `*.py` → python, `Containerfile` → oci). Annotations (`<!-- skills: python, k8s -->`) override auto-matching
- **Model tier routing**: Each child resolves an execution tier — explicit annotation > skill-based hint > default. Provider-neutral tier labels resolve to concrete models through the session routing policy
- **Adversarial review loop** (opt-in via `review: true`): After each child completes, an opus-tier reviewer checks for bugs, security issues, and spec compliance. Severity-gated: nits→accept, warnings→1 fix iteration, criticals→2 fixes then escalate, security→immediate escalate. Churn detection bails when >50% of issues reappear between rounds
- **Large-run preflight**: Asks which provider to favor before expensive dispatches, preventing mid-run subscription exhaustion

### 🌲 Design Tree

Structured design exploration with persistent markdown documents — the upstream of OpenSpec.

- **Tools**: `design_tree` (query), `design_tree_update` (create/mutate nodes)
- **Commands**: `/design list`, `/design new`, `/design update`, `/design branch`, `/design decide`, `/design implement`
- **Document structure**: Frontmatter (status, tags, dependencies, priority, issue_type, open questions) + sections (Overview, Research, Decisions, Open Questions, Implementation Notes)
- **Work triage**: `design_tree(action="ready")` returns all decided, dependency-resolved nodes sorted by priority — the session-start "what next?" query
- **Blocked audit**: `design_tree(action="blocked")` returns all stalled nodes with each blocking dependency's id, title, and status
- **Priority**: `set_priority` (1 = critical → 5 = trivial) on any node; `ready` auto-sorts by it
- **Issue types**: `set_issue_type` classifies nodes as `epic | feature | task | bug | chore` — bugs and chores are now first-class tracked work
- **OpenSpec bridge**: `design_tree_update` with `action: "implement"` scaffolds `openspec/changes/<node-id>/` from a decided node's content; `/cleave` executes it
- **Full pipeline**: design → decide → implement → `/cleave` → `/assess spec` → archive

### 🧠 Project Memory

Persistent, cross-session knowledge stored in SQLite. Accumulates architectural decisions, constraints, patterns, and known issues — retrieved semantically each session.

- **11 tools**: `memory_store`, `memory_recall`, `memory_query`, `memory_supersede`, `memory_archive`, `memory_connect`, `memory_compact`, `memory_episodes`, `memory_focus`, `memory_release`, `memory_search_archive`
- **Semantic retrieval**: Embedding-based search via Ollama (`qwen3-embedding`), falls back to FTS5 keyword search
- **Background extraction**: Auto-discovers facts from tool output without interrupting work
- **Episodic memory**: Generates session narratives at shutdown for "what happened last time" context
- **Global knowledge base**: Cross-project facts at `~/.pi/memory/global.db`
- **Git sync**: Exports to JSONL for version-controlled knowledge sharing across machines

![Memory Lifecycle](docs/img/memory-lifecycle.png)

### 📊 Dashboard

Live status panel showing design tree, OpenSpec changes, cleave dispatch, and git branches at a glance.

- **Commands**: `/dash` (toggle compact ↔ raised), `/dashboard` (open side panel)
- **Compact mode**: Single footer line — design/openspec/cleave summaries + context gauge
- **Raised mode**: Full-width expanded view (toggle with `/dash`)
  - Git branch tree rooted at repo name, annotated with linked design nodes
  - Two-column split at ≥120 terminal columns: design tree + cleave left, OpenSpec right
  - Context gauge · model · thinking level in shared footer zone
  - No line cap — renders as much content as needed
- **Keyboard**: `Ctrl+Shift+B` toggles raised/compact

### 🌐 Web UI

Localhost-only, read-only HTTP dashboard that exposes live control-plane state as JSON. It binds to `127.0.0.1`, is not started automatically, and serves no mutation endpoints in the MVP.

- **Command**: `/web-ui [start|stop|status|open]`
- **Shell**: polling-first HTML dashboard
- **Endpoints**: `GET /api/state`, plus slice routes `/api/session`, `/api/dashboard`, `/api/design-tree`, `/api/openspec`, `/api/cleave`, `/api/models`, `/api/memory`, `/api/health`
- **State contract**: versioned `ControlPlaneState` (schema v1)

### ⚔️ Effort Tiers

Single global knob controlling the inference intensity across the entire harness. Seven named tiers using provider-neutral labels — tier labels resolve to concrete model IDs from whichever provider (Anthropic or OpenAI) the session routing policy prefers.

| Tier | Name | Driver | Thinking | Review |
|------|------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Servitor** | local | off | local |
| 2 | **Average** | local | minimal | local |
| 3 | **Substantial** | sonnet | low | sonnet |
| 4 | **Ruthless** | sonnet | medium | sonnet |
| 5 | **Lethal** | sonnet | high | opus |
| 6 | **Absolute** | opus | high | opus |
| 7 | **Omnissiah** | opus | high | opus |

- `/effort <name>` — switch tier mid-session
- `/effort cap` — lock current tier as ceiling; agent cannot self-upgrade past it
- `/effort uncap` — remove ceiling lock
- Affects: driver model, thinking level, extraction, compaction, cleave child floor, review model

### 🤖 Local Inference

Delegate sub-tasks to locally running LLMs via Ollama — zero API cost.

- **Tools**: `ask_local_model`, `list_local_models`
- **Commands**: `/local-models`, `/local-status`
- Auto-discovers available models on session start

### 🔌 Offline Driver

Switch the driving model from cloud to a local Ollama model when connectivity drops or for fully offline operation.

- **Tool**: `switch_to_offline_driver`
- Auto-selects best available model from a hardware-aware preference list
- Model registry in `extensions/lib/local-models.ts` — one file to update when new models land
- Covers: 64GB (70B), 32GB (32B), 24GB (14B/MoE-30B), 16GB (8B), 8GB (4B)

### 💰 Model Budget

Switch model tiers to match task complexity and conserve API spend. Tier labels are provider-neutral — resolved at runtime through the session routing policy.

- **Tool**: `set_model_tier` — `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` / `local`
- **Tool**: `set_thinking_level` — `off` / `minimal` / `low` / `medium` / `high`
- Downgrade for routine edits, upgrade for architecture decisions
- Respects effort tier cap — cannot upgrade past a locked ceiling

### 🎨 Render

Generate images and diagrams directly in the terminal.

- **FLUX.1 image generation** via MLX on Apple Silicon — `generate_image_local`
- **D2 diagrams** rendered inline — `render_diagram`
- **Native SVG/PNG diagrams** for canonical motifs (pipeline, fanout, panel-split) — `render_native_diagram`
- **Excalidraw** JSON-to-PNG rendering — `render_excalidraw`

### 🔍 Web Search

Multi-provider web search with deduplication.

- **Tool**: `web_search`
- **Providers**: Brave, Tavily, Serper (Google)
- **Modes**: `quick` (single provider, fastest), `deep` (more results), `compare` (all providers, best for research)

### 🗂️ Tool Profiles

Enable or disable tools and switch named profiles to keep the context window lean.

- **Tool**: `manage_tools`
- **Command**: `/profile [name|reset]`
- Pre-built profiles for common workflows; per-tool enable/disable for fine-grained control

### 📖 Vault

Markdown viewport for project documentation — serves docs with wikilink navigation and graph view.

- **Command**: `/vault`

### 🔐 Secrets

Resolve secrets from environment variables, shell commands, or system keychains — without storing values in config.

- Declarative `@secret` annotations in extension headers
- Sources: `env:`, `cmd:`, `keychain:`

### 🌐 MCP Bridge

Connect external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers as native pi tools.

- Bridges MCP tool schemas into pi's tool registry
- Stdio transport for local MCP servers

## Requirements

**Required:**
- `@cwilson613/pi-coding-agent` ≥ 0.57 — patched fork of [badlogic/pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Install via `npm install -g @cwilson613/pi-coding-agent`. Fork source: [cwilson613/pi-mono](https://github.com/cwilson613/pi-mono)

**Optional (installed by `/bootstrap`):**
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) — local inference, offline mode, semantic memory search
- [d2](https://d2lang.com) — diagram rendering
- [mflux](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux) — FLUX.1 image generation on Apple Silicon
- API keys for web search (Brave, Tavily, or Serper)

Run `/bootstrap` after install to check dependencies and configure preferences.

## Why a Patched Fork?

Upstream [`badlogic/pi-mono`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) is the canonical pi coding agent. Omegon depends on a fork rather than the upstream package for two reasons:

1. **OAuth login reliability** — upstream had no fetch timeout on OAuth token exchange calls. A slow or unreachable endpoint would hang the login UI indefinitely with no recovery path. Fixed in [`packages/ai/src/utils/oauth/`](https://github.com/cwilson613/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/ai/src/utils/oauth).

2. **Bracketed-paste stuck state** — a missing end-marker (e.g. from a large paste that split across chunks) would leave `isInPaste = true` permanently, silently swallowing all subsequent keystrokes including Enter. Fixed with a 500ms watchdog timer and Escape-to-clear in [`packages/tui/src/components/input.ts`](https://github.com/cwilson613/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/tui/src/components/input.ts).

Both fixes are submitted as PRs to upstream ([#2060](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2060), [#2061](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2061)). Once merged, the fork becomes a pass-through and the dependency can revert to `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`.
